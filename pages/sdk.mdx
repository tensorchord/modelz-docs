# SDK

In this section, we will introduce how to use the SDK to interact with Modelz.

## Python

We provide a Python SDK for interacting with Modelz. You can install it with `pip`:

```bash copy
pip install modelz-py
```

You could use the following code to make a prediction request:

```python copy
# pip install modelz-py
import modelz

# Or you could set the environment variable MODELZ_API_KEY
key = "mzi-abcde..."

client = modelz.ModelzClient(key=key, project="stable-diffusion-w41s2qknzjo0fk3i", serde="msgpack")
resp = client.inference(params="cute cat")
```
