# Framework

Inference server frameworks are the ultimate wingmen for machine learning models. They not only provide support and infrastructure for models to shine in a production environment, but also feature load-balancing and caching/batching capabilities, so your models can sit back and relax while the server takes care of all their workload.

We currently have two open-sourced inference server frameworks available with respective use cases:

For **high-performance** and flexible model serving in a **production** environment, we have [**Mosec**](../frameworks/mosec). It's perfect for building ML model-enabled backend and microservices that can handle large volumes of requests and scale effortlessly.

For quick and simple **prototyping** of ML model-enabled **web UI** apps, we have [**Gradio**](../frameworks/gradio). Using this framework, you can build and deploy your machine learning models in a web application in minutes, and easily share it with other users.

Both frameworks could integrate with popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. They also support a wide range of model formats, including ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, and PyTorch TorchScript.
