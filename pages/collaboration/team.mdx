# Team Collaboration

After having signed up to ModelZ, youâ€™ve automatically received a personal account that you can use to run and deploy personal models. To deploy collaborate with others, however, you can create or join additional teams.

## Create a Team

You can create a team, and fill in your team member's e-mail address and role. 
- If the email of team member is already signed up in ModelZ, the member will receive a team invitation by e-mail. After accepting the invitation, he can see the team in his team list.
- If email is not signed up in ModelZ, the member will receive a sign up email with invitation.

## Role
Teams have two different role with different levels of access privileges:
- Owner
- Member

The user that creates a team is automatically set as the Owner for that team. The owner can assign any other roles within the team, as well as pending other members of the workspace.

Member of a team can not assign any access privileges within the workspace but can otherwise perform any action like running and deploying models and modify Secrets.

## Leave Team

To leave a team, navigate to the settings page and click `Leave` on a team.
