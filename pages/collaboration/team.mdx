## Role
Teams have two different role with different levels of access privileges:
- Owner
- Member
- Pending

The user that creates a team is automatically set as the Owner for that team. The owner can assign any other roles within the team, as well as pending other members of the workspace.

Member of a team can not assign any access privileges within the workspace but can perform actions like creating deployments and modifying Secrets.

Pending means the invited user not accept the invitation or the owner doesn't want the member to work on the team's resources anymore.

## Leave Team

To leave a team, navigate to the settings page and click `Leave` on a team.
