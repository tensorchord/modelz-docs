# Mosec

[Mosec](https://github.com/mosecorg/mosec) is a high-performance and flexible model serving framework for building ML model-enabled backend and microservices. It bridges the gap between any machine learning models you just trained and the efficient online service API.

- **Highly performant**: web layer and task coordination built with Rust ðŸ¦€, which offers blazing speed in addition to efficient CPU utilization powered by async I/O
- **Dynamic batching**: aggregate requests from different users for batched inference and distribute results back
- **Pipelined stages**: spawn multiple processes for pipelined stages to handle CPU/GPU/IO mixed workloads

## Use templates

We provide a set of templates to help you quickly get started with Mosec. You can find them in the [templates](../templates).

## Installation

Mosec requires Python 3.7 or above. Install the latest [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/mosec/) with:

```shell copy
pip install -U mosec
```

## Hello Stable Diffusion

We demonstrate how Mosec can help you easily host a pre-trained stable diffusion model as a service. You need to install [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) as prerequisites:

```shell copy
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch] transformers
```

### Write the server

We **build an API** for clients to query a text prompt and obtain an image based on the [stable-diffusion-v1-5 model](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) in just 3 steps.

```python {2,10} copy
class StableDiffusion(MsgpackMixin, Worker):
    def __init__(self):
        self.pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
            "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16
        )
        device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
        self.pipe = self.pipe.to(device)
        self.example = ["useless example prompt"] * 4  # warmup (bs=4)

    def forward(self, data: List[str]) -> List[memoryview]:
        logger.debug("generate images for %s", data)
        res = self.pipe(data)
        logger.debug("NSFW: %s", res[1])
        images = []
        for img in res[0]:
            dummy_file = BytesIO()
            img.save(dummy_file, format="JPEG")
            images.append(dummy_file.getbuffer())
        return images
```

1) Define your service as a class which inherits `mosec.Worker`. Here we also inherit `MsgpackMixin` to employ the [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) serialization format<sup>(a)</sup>.

2) Inside the `__init__` method, initialize your model and put it onto the corresponding device. Optionally you can assign `self.example` with some data to warm up<sup>(b)</sup> the model. Note that the data should be compatible with your handler's input format, which we detail next.

3) Override the `forward` method to write your service handler<sup>(c)</sup>, with the signature `forward(self, data: Any | List[Any]) -> Any | List[Any]`. Receiving/returning a single item or a tuple depends on whether [dynamic batching](#configuration)<sup>(d)</sup> is configured.


> **Note**
>
> (a) In this example we return an image in the binary format, which JSON does not support (unless encoded with base64 that makes it longer). Hence, msgpack suits our need better. If we do not inherit `MsgpackMixin`, JSON will be used by default. In other words, the protocol of the service request or response can either be msgpack or JSON.
>
> (b) Warm-up usually helps to allocate GPU memory in advance. If the warm-up example is specified, the service will only be ready after the example is forwarded through the handler. However, if no example is given, the first request's latency is expected to be longer. The `example` should be set as a single item or a tuple depending on what `forward` expects to receive. Moreover, in the case where you want to warm up with multiple different examples, you may set `multi_examples` (demo [here](https://mosecorg.github.io/mosec/example/jax/)).
>
> (c) This example shows a single-stage service, where the `StableDiffusion` worker directly takes in client's prompt request and responds the image. Thus the `forward` can be considered as a complete service handler. However, we can also design a multi-stage service with workers doing different jobs (e.g., downloading images, forward model, post-processing) in a pipeline. In this case, the whole pipeline is considered as the service handler, with the first worker taking in the request and the last worker sending out the response. The data flow between workers is done by inter-process communication.
>
> (d) Since dynamic batching is enabled in this example, the `forward` method will wishfully receive a _list_ of string, e.g., `['a cute cat playing with a red ball', 'a man sitting in front of a computer', ...]`, aggregated from different clients for _batch inference_, improving the system throughput.

Finally, we append the worker to the server to construct a *single-stage* workflow (multiple stages can be [pipelined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) to further boost the throughput, see [this example](https://mosecorg.github.io/mosec/example/pytorch/#computer-vision)), and specify the number of processes we want it to run in parallel (`num=1`), and the maximum batch size (`max_batch_size=4`, the maximum number of requests dynamic batching will accumulate before timeout; timeout is defined with the flag `--wait` in milliseconds, meaning the longest time Mosec waits until sending the batch to the Worker).

```python copy
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = Server()
    # 1) `num` specify the number of processes that will be spawned to run in parallel.
    # 2) By configuring the `max_batch_size` with the value > 1, the input data in your
    # `forward` function will be a list (batch); otherwise, it's a single item.
    server.append_worker(StableDiffusion, num=1, max_batch_size=4)
    server.run()
```
