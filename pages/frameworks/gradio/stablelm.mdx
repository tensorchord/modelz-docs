StableLM is a large language model by [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models). It is trained on a new experimental dataset built on The Pile, but three times larger with 1.5 trillion tokens of content.

You could deploy it [here](https://cloud.modelz.ai/deployment/template) to generate text, do text classification, and more.
