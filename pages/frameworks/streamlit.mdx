# Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

## Hello World

This is a simple example of a Streamlit app that takes a name as input and returns a greeting as output:

```python copy
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello World!")
```

## Use templates

We have several templates for streamlit apps. You could find them below. They can be deployed to ModelZ directly.

## Build from scratch

You could also build your own app from scratch. You could use our template [modelz-template-streamlit](https://github.com/tensorchord/modelz-template-streamlit) to bootstrap your project.

You will need to provide three key components:

- A `main.py` file: This file contains the code for making predictions.
- A `requirements.txt` file: This file lists all the dependencies required for the server code to run.
- A `Dockerfile` or a simpler [`build.envd`](https://envd.tensorchord.ai/guide/getting-started.html): This file contains instructions for building a Docker image that encapsulates the server code and its dependencies.

In the `Dockerfile`, you need to define the instructions for building a Docker image that encapsulates the server code and its dependencies.

In most cases, you could use the template in the repository.

```bash copy
docker build -t docker.io/USER/IMAGE .
docker push docker.io/USER/IMAGE

# GPU
docker build -t docker.io/USER/IMAGE -f Dockerfile.gpu .
docker push docker.io/USER/IMAGE
```

On the other hand, a [`build.envd`](https://envd.tensorchord.ai/guide/getting-started.html) is a simplified alternative to a Dockerfile. It provides python-based interfaces that contains configuration settings for building a image. 

It is easier to use than a Dockerfile as it involves specifying only the dependencies of your machine learning model, not the instructions for CUDA, conda, and other system-level dependencies.

```bash copy
envd build --output type=image,name=docker.io/USER/IMAGE,push=true
# GPU
envd build --output type=image,name=docker.io/USER/IMAGE,push=true -f :build_gpu
```

## Deploy Gradio apps to ModelZ

You could deploy your Gradio app to ModelZ following the [**Deploy**](../gettingstarted/deploy) section in the Getting Started guide.
