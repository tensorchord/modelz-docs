# Baize (7B)

[Baize](https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot) is an open-source chat model trained with LoRA. It uses 100k dialogs generated by letting ChatGPT chat with itself. We also use Alpaca's data to improve its performance. We have released 7B, 13B and 30B models. Please refer to the paper for more details.
