# HuggingGPT (Jarvis)

[HuggingGPT (Jarvis)](https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS) is a collaborative system that consists of **an LLM as the controller** and **numerous expert models as collaborative executors** (from HuggingFace Hub). The workflow of our system consists of four stages:
+ **Task Planning**: Using ChatGPT to analyze the requests of users to understand their intention, and disassemble them into possible solvable tasks.
+ **Model Selection**: To solve the planned tasks, ChatGPT selects expert models hosted on Hugging Face based on their descriptions.
+ **Task Execution**: Invokes and executes each selected model, and return the results to ChatGPT.
+ **Response Generation**: Finally, using ChatGPT to integrate the prediction of all models, and generate responses.
