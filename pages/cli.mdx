# ModelZ CLI

ModelZ CLI is a command line interface that allows you to make predictions with your deployed models.

## Installation

You could install the CLI by running the following command:

```bash copy
pip install modelz-py
```

## Usage

You could use `modelz inference` to send a prediction request to the server:

```bash copy
modelz inference -d $DEPLOYMENT_KEY prompt="cute cat"
```

Or retrieve the deployment metrics:

```bash copy
modelz metrics -d $DEPLOYMENT_KEY
```

For more details, check the help message and [CLI docs](https://tensorchord.github.io/modelz-py/cli.html):

```bash copy
modelz --help
modelz inference --help
modelz metrics --help
```

You need to replace `$DEPLOYMENT_KEY` with the key of your deployment. Besides this, you need to set the environment variable `MODELZ_API_KEY` to your API key. You could get it from the [**API Keys**](https://cloud.modelz.ai/settings/user) page.
